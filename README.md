# Framework-macropad
Working Vial Keyboard for Framework 16 Macropad

This is cobbled together from the FrameworkComputer repo, as well as support from MJ1 and others.
I had to modify and remove the serial number overrides from framework. I don't know what bad things this causes, use at your own risk.
